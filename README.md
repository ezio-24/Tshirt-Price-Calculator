The T-Shirt Price Calculator is a project that allows users to calculate the price of a t-shirt based on various factors such as color, quality, and quantity. The calculator aims to provide an accurate estimation by considering these different parameters.

Here's a breakdown of how the T-Shirt Price Calculator works:

**Input Parameters:**
- Color: Users can specify the color of the t-shirt they want to purchase. Different colors might have varying costs due to the manufacturing process or material used.
- Quality: Users can select the desired quality of the t-shirt, which can range from basic to premium. Higher quality materials may result in higher prices.
- Quantity: Users can enter the number of t-shirts they wish to order. Bulk orders often come with discounts or different pricing structures.

**Calculation:**
Based on the input parameters provided by the user, the T-Shirt Price Calculator performs calculations to determine the total cost of the t-shirts. Each factor (color, quality, and quantity) is taken into account using pre-defined cost values associated with each option.

For example, if a user selects a black t-shirt (which might be more expensive than a white one), premium quality fabric (which may also be pricier), and wants to order 10 t-shirts, the calculator will multiply the cost of a black t-shirt with premium quality fabric by the quantity selected (10).

Once the calculation is complete, the T-Shirt Price Calculator displays the total cost of the t-shirts to the user.

**Benefits and Use Cases:**
- The T-Shirt Price Calculator simplifies the process of determining the total cost of t-shirts, especially for businesses that need to place bulk orders.
- It helps users make informed decisions about the pricing options available to them, allowing them to adjust their selections based on their budget constraints.
- By providing transparency in the pricing structure, customers can compare prices and choose the most cost-effective options for their requirements.

**Additional Features:**
The T-Shirt Price Calculator can be expanded with additional features to enhance its functionality. Some potential enhancements include:
- Customization Options: Allowing users to select additional customization options such as printing, embroidery, or different styles (v-neck, round neck, etc.), which can affect the final price.
- Discounts and Coupons: Incorporating options for applying discounts or entering coupon codes to provide users with additional savings.
- Tax Calculation: Adding tax calculation functionality to display the final price inclusive of taxes.
